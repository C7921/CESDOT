Yay! Dotsfiles.

My personal take on dotfiles and setting up a mac.


## Fresh Setup Guide
1. Update to latest version of macoS, sign in with AppleID.
2. Install Xcode from the app store.
3. Install Xcode command line tools.
4. Clone the repo and fire away! (I think...)
5. Fingers crossed nothing explodes.
